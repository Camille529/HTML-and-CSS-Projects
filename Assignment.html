		<h3> <p> Here is a quote from Bloom & Wild's website:</p>
		<blockquote 
		cite="https://www.bloomandwild.com/the-meaning-and-symbolism-of-tulip-flowers">
			Pink tulips are known for meaning affection, caring, good wishes, and love. Although not as deep or passionate love as red tulips represent. Pink tulips are great to send to friends and family members to show them you care. If you want to congratulate someone on a new job, a promotion or graduation, pink tulips say it best!
